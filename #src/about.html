						<h4>Ok, here’s my story</h4>
						
						<p>
							My name is Yuri Dynys. I used to be a lawyer (uh, actually I AM a lawyer, it’s like to be a marine – it’s not a profession, but a lifetime status) for a long, long time, and then something amazing happened – my son was born. When he was three, he asked me to tell him a bedtime story. I tried to remember some, but I’d forgotton all the children’s tales I’d heard before.  So I made up my own tale, and that one was a complete success. Then there was a new story, and another new story, and another new story, and one evening my kid asked me to tell a story I’d told him a few weeks before. But I couldn’t remember it! Since that time I started to record all our stories on a tape recorder. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Three years later we had over two hundred stories. When I was busy, my son listened to the old stories on  the tape recorder (a useful know-how, when you’re a tired father, huh?). We invented adventures and new heroes together, and that was great fun for both of us. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Suddenly my son became six, went to school, started learning to read and showed no interest in reading – “That’s so boring, daddy!”. “All right,” I said, “Gimme that tape recorder!”.
						</p>
						<p>
							And I wrote a story. “Here, read it, you’ll like it”, I gave him a thin pack  of paper. “Huh, so many letters…” my kid said. “That’s so boring, daddy!”. “All right,” I said, then I went out and met a lovely artist – Julia Tolmachova. She made a beautiful illustration for that story, and finally, to my surprise, the first book was born - “The Grey Dust Planet”. “Here, read it, you’ll like it. And start learning to read!” I gave him the book. “Wow, that’s nice!” my kid said. “Oh no! It’s for kids!”. “Jesus Crist, you’re seven, who do you think you are?!” “I’m a teenager. Well, a small teenager,” said my son, giving the book back to me. “And I’ve already passed the reading tests”.
						</p>
						<p>
							That was enough for me. ‘I will always be a lawyer, but my son will never be a kid again. He needs me now. And I don’t want to miss the best years of his childhood – and the best years of my fatherhood.’ 
						</p>
						<p>
							So, I paused my career as a lawyer, founded a fatherhood community “Tatovi kazky” (“Daddy’s tales” in English), and became a full-time father and children’s writer. All that happened five years ago.
						</p>
						<p>
							For five years me, my son Damir and Julia have been working on “Space bunch” books. And now we are ready to present them. Enjoy!
