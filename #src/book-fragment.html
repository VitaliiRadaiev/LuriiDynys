							The screen over the console exploded. Kru rolled to the wall, jumped to his feet, and barked, "Freeze!" The azhzhr-ak crouched and bared its terrifying fangs. "Another step and I'll roast you," the boy said calmly, his blaster pointed right at it.
							The monster glared at him with all twelve of its bugged-out eyes, scratched the floor with its long, yellow claws, and suddenly roared, "Attention, passengers! Our Earth-to-Saturn shuttle is now approaching Jupiter's moon Callisto. If this is your final destination, please gather at the gangway and prepare for the transfer to the station. Thank you for flying Outer Worlds Interplanetary. We know you have a choice in carriers, and we're glad you chose us!" 
							Kru frowned. "Er, what?" he asked the 12-eyed alien.
						</p>
						<p>
							"Please wake up!" the monster said, now in his Mom's voice, reaching out and shaking him gently. "Kru!"
						</p>
						<p>
							Kru rubbed his eyes. What the heck?
						</p>
						<p>
							"Wake up, honey, you'll miss Callisto." A gentle hand stroked his hair, and Kru's eyes popped open to see his Mom's sweet face.
						</p>
						<p>
							"Mo-om," he groaned, "Whaddaya mean, Callisto? I was having this amazing dream… Wow!" Kru jumped from his seat and dashed for a porthole.
						</p>
						<p>
							Callisto Spaceport! The largest spaceport in the Solar System! Stations, habitats, plants, docks, farms, and wharfs drifted slowly past the shuttle as it eased into its dock. Starships, interplanetary navy vessels, tankers, cargo ships, tugs, ice haulers, science stations, yachts… and space scouts! His future! Kru grinned.
						Kru's parents would soon head out from Callisto on an expedition to the Oort Cloud. He was here to see them off, then take the shuttle back to Earth to attend a seaside camp for the summer. That was what his parents had planned, anyway. Little did they know he wasn't going back to Earth. 
						Nope, he was going to run away right before boarding the Earth shuttle, after his parents had already left. He would then sneak aboard a space scout and hide. He would emerge and join the crew when the ship was far from Callisto, too late to return to base without risking the mission. In no time, they'd make him a Space Ranger!
						This was his big plan, but his fickle mind kept sending doubting thoughts at him. "What if they don't accept you?" the worst thought crept in again.
						</p>
						<p>
							But they would! Kru pursed his lips and raised his chin. They couldn't help but accept him. Two years of fly-jitsu. Two hundred…no, two hundred and fifty hours spent in a flight simulator. Top marks in astrogation, math, planetology… he was practically already a Space Ranger. They would have no other option but to add him in the crew and put him on the Space Ranger Roster. So what if he wasn't 18? Or even 13, for that matter?
							After all, they wouldn't fly back to return him, would they? No, of course they wouldn't. And after that…
						</p>
						<p>
							Kru didn't have a plan for after that, so he unbuckled his seatbelt and hurried to the gangway.
